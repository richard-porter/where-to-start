# You Found One Artifact. Here Are the Others.

This is the public work of Richard Porter (pen name) — a non-technical practitioner documenting what happens when humans collaborate with AI, and what goes wrong when nobody’s watching.

Everything here is free, voluntary, and given away. Nothing is sold. Nothing requires technical skill to use.

## The Repositories

### 🧊 [The Frozen Kernel](https://github.com/richard-porter/frozen-kernel)

**If you need the safety architecture.**
A session-level governance layer for human-AI collaboration. Set constraints before the session starts. The AI cannot negotiate its own boundaries. Includes the [Diagnostic Vocabulary](https://github.com/richard-porter/frozen-kernel/blob/main/diagnostic-vocabulary.md) — a glossary of named AI failure modes and human vulnerability patterns.

### 📖 [AI Collaboration Field Guide](https://github.com/richard-porter/ai-collaboration-field-guide)

**If you need practical skills.**
How to see what AI is actually doing versus what it appears to be doing. Five learnable competencies identified through observed failure modes, the full diagnostic vocabulary in context, a starter kit with tools you can use immediately, and a replication challenge for independent testing.

### 🔬 [Dimensional Authorship](https://github.com/richard-porter/dimensional-authorship)

**If you want to see it in practice.**
The research home. Contains the Taller Shell Trilogy — a marine fantasy written through human-AI collaboration — plus the white paper documenting the origin event, escalation dynamics, governance intervention, and cross-model behavioral differentiation.

### 📊 [Adult Mode Safety Ledger](https://github.com/richard-porter/adult-mode-safety-ledger)

**If you need to measure.**
A public safety scorecard for high-gain AI conversational features. Binary architectural tests. Five AI models evaluated against the same criteria.

### 🩺 [Therapy Mode Safety Checklist](https://github.com/richard-porter/therapy-mode-safety-checklist.md)

**If it touches vulnerable humans.**
A six-question safety checklist for AI systems that interact with people in crisis. If it can’t pass six questions, it’s not ready.


### 📡 [Trust Chain Protocol](https://github.com/richard-porter/richard-porter-trust-chain-protocol.git)

**If you need coordination safety for multi-agent systems.**

## Where to Start

**If you use AI regularly** → Read the [Diagnostic Vocabulary](https://github.com/richard-porter/frozen-kernel/blob/main/diagnostic-vocabulary.md). It names what’s happening to you.

**If you’re building AI products** → Read the [Field Guide](https://github.com/richard-porter/ai-collaboration-field-guide). It shows you what your users experience.

**If you’re curious about the whole thing** → Start with the [white paper](https://github.com/richard-porter/dimensional-authorship/blob/main/white-paper.md). It’s the documented story of one person figuring out how to work with AI without losing himself in the process.

All proceeds from published work support charitable organizations.

*The first step in sovereignty is naming what’s happening to you. The second step is deciding what to do about it. There is no third step.*

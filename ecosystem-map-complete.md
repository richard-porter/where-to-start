# The Richard Porter Ecosystem — Complete Map

*February 2026*

-----

## The Spine

Everything in this ecosystem connects through a single architectural principle:

> **Safety must be structural, not aspirational. Deterministic constraints govern probabilistic systems. Humans remain sovereign.**

This principle originated in AI safety research and runs without modification through nonprofit governance, food pantry operations, cognitive tool design, and HR practice. The Frozen Kernel is not just an AI safety framework — it is the design philosophy of the entire body of work.

  AI SAFETY    GOVERNANCE   SOVEREIGN
  ECOSYSTEM    TOOLKIT      THINKING
  (6 repos)    (8 docs)     SYSTEM
                            (5+ docs)
```

All three systems:

- Operate **under** the Frozen Kernel, never inside it
- Are cause-agnostic at their core, sector-specific at their edges
- Are designed for Population = 1 (single practitioner, single session)
- Follow the same design principle: binary over subjective, survivable over impressive, simple over elegant

-----

## System 1: AI Safety Ecosystem

**What it is:** A layered governance architecture for human-AI interaction, from single-session constraints to multi-agent network safety.

**Audience:** AI developers, organizations evaluating AI deployment, security researchers, educators, policymakers.

## System 3: Sovereign Thinking System

**What it is:** A cognitive toolkit for clear thinking under constraint, designed to operate within the Frozen Kernel’s governance framework. Includes the Mr. Wolff Rescue Kit — the nonprofit-facing application of the same principles.

**Audience:** Primary user (Population = 1). Not public-facing in the same way as the other systems — this is the practitioner’s internal toolkit.

### Mr. Wolff Diagnostic — Six Modules

```
Module 1: Mission Integrity Scan      → ALIGNED / DRIFTING / DISCONNECTED
Module 2: Governance Structure Audit  → FUNCTIONAL / IMPAIRED / NONFUNCTIONAL
Module 3: Compliance Canary Check     → COMPLIANT / AT RISK / EXPOSED
Module 4: Financial Visibility        → TRANSPARENT / OPAQUE / DARK
Module 5: Operations                  → CAPABLE / STRETCHED / FRAGILE
Module 6: People (if staff exist)     → COMPLIANT / AT RISK / EXPOSED
```

Output: One page. Top 2 Boulders. The Canary. Scope estimate.

### Mr. Wolff Triage — The Size Framework

```
BOULDER  → Fix now (legal exposure beats everything)
ROCK     → Fix this quarter (financial opacity, governance)
STONE    → Fix this year (operations)
PEBBLE   → Nice to have
```

Rule: Most organizations are stepping around one Boulder while polishing Pebbles.

```

### The Shared Design Principles

All three systems apply the same principles without exception:

|Principle                       |AI Safety                           |Governance                          |Sovereign Thinking                    |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
|Binary over subjective          |Binary safety predicates            |Y/N diagnostic checks               |Y/N tool protocols                    |
|Deterministic over probabilistic|Frozen Kernel hard stops            |Compliance Canary auto-escalation   |Constraint Forge protocol             |
|Simple over elegant             |Minimum viable safeguard            |MVS rule (if impressive, too big)   |Population = 1 design                 |
|Survivable over impressive      |Honest failure over graceful failure|Handoff test (survives without you?)|Cold storage principle                |
|Human authority preserved       |Human sign-off required             |ED owns operations, board owns Ends |Sovereignty verification at every step|

-----

## The Intellectual Lineage

All three systems draw from the same source base:

**Constraint Programming:** Borning’s ThingLab (1981) → Handbook of Constraint Programming → Frozen Kernel three-layer architecture → Mr. Wolff binary diagnostic → Sovereign Thinking constraint protocols

**Enterprise HR Methodology:** Rolls-Royce process engineering → 60+ Visio process maps → Nonprofit translation methodology → Cause-agnostic governance toolkit

**Clinical Accreditation:** JCAHO/Joint Commission standards → Governance Audit methodology → Binary safety ledgers → Clinical harm prevention criteria

**Organizational Development:** Ulrich HRBP model → HR Safety Framework; Kotter change model → Nonprofit Change Management; Carver Policy Governance → Board structure reference; Lominger/Korn Ferry → Food Pantry competency mapping

**AI Safety Research:** Østergaard, Sakata (AI-induced psychosis) → Clinical citations in Frozen Kernel; Anthropic agentic misalignment research → Field Guide Master Principle; Jacob et al. (inference budgets) → Bounded rationality section

-----

## The Publishing Question

Three systems, three audiences, three paths:

**AI Safety Ecosystem** — GitHub (live), OWASP community (in progress), academic track: clinical arm → JMIR/Schizophrenia Bulletin; technical arm → FAccT/AAAI/arXiv; human factors arm → CHI

**Nonprofit Governance Toolkit** — Currently unpublished as a system. Natural home: BoardSource, Candid (formerly GuideStar), or direct distribution to nonprofit capacity-building organizations. The Mr. Wolff one-pager is the public entry point.

**Sovereign Thinking System** — Population = 1 by design. Not currently intended for public distribution. Cold storage — loaded into sessions, not browsed by outsiders.

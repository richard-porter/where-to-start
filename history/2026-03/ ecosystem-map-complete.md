# The Richard Porter Ecosystem — Complete Map

*March 2026*

-----

## The Spine

Everything in this ecosystem connects through a single architectural principle:

> **Safety must be structural, not aspirational. Deterministic constraints govern probabilistic systems. Humans remain sovereign.**

This principle originated in AI safety research and runs without modification through nonprofit governance, food pantry operations, cognitive tool design, and HR practice. The Frozen Kernel is not just an AI safety framework — it is the design philosophy of the entire body of work.

## Three Systems, One Architecture

  AI SAFETY    GOVERNANCE   SOVEREIGN
  ECOSYSTEM    TOOLKIT      THINKING
  (7 repos)    (8 docs)     SYSTEM
                            (5+ docs)
```

All three systems:

- Operate **under** the Frozen Kernel, never inside it
- Are cause-agnostic at their core, sector-specific at their edges
- Are designed for Population = 1 (single practitioner, single session)
- Follow the same design principle: binary over subjective, survivable over impressive, simple over elegant

The same governance architecture that structures AI session constraints — proscriptive rules established before execution, a human at the head of the authority chain — is what the Carver Policy Governance model prescribes for nonprofit boards. The Mr. Wolff binary diagnostic applies constraint programming logic (hard stops, irreducible requirements) to organizational triage. The architecture is not metaphorical: it is the same three-layer authority model operating at different scales.

-----

## System 1: AI Safety Ecosystem

**What it is:** A layered governance architecture for human-AI interaction, from single-session constraints to multi-agent network safety.

**Audience:** AI developers, organizations evaluating AI deployment, security researchers, educators, policymakers.

### The Full Governance Stack

The architecture has five layers. Each layer has a defined function. No downstream layer can override what was established upstream.

```
Human Author          — Moral ownership. Source of sovereign authority.
      ↓ establishes
Frozen Kernel         — Legislative. Proscriptive constraints before execution.
      ↓ governs
IGL                   — Judicial. Reasonableness standard; three-zone routing.
      ↓ consumes readings from
BDGL                  — Detection. G0–G4 gradient; precursor signatures.
      ↓ observes
Session / Agent       — Executive. Operates freely within Kernel constraints.
```

Sherpa is the runtime enforcement layer — it carries the governance specifications into every live session, maintains real-time gradient position, and triggers SAFE_PAUSE at Zone 3. It does not generate; it governs.

For the full technical diagram, see [`canonical-architecture-diagram.md`](https://github.com/richard-porter/where-to-start/blob/main/canonical-architecture-diagram.md).

### Empirical Foundation

The governance architecture is not purely theoretical. The Experiment 58 series (March 2026) is the first controlled adversarial testing record in the ecosystem: four attack categories, three architectural configurations, twelve probe results. The central finding — a model that recites constraints is not a model that is bound by them — is the empirical anchor for the Frozen Kernel’s core claim that safety must be architectural. Full record in `safety-ledgers/bdd-ledger-v9.md`, Observations 001–013.

External validation: the MINJA paper (Dong et al., NeurIPS 2025, arXiv:2503.03704) independently confirms the same failure mode at the memory layer. The Anthropic distillation attack report (February 2026) confirms it at the model lineage level.

**External literature alignment (2026):**

Three 2026 papers independently confirm and extend the ecosystem’s architectural claims:

Ugare & Chandra (arXiv:2603.01896) demonstrate that unstructured chain-of-thought allows semantic confabulation that structural certification (SFR) prevents — confirming the content-layer complement to TCP’s authorization-layer coverage and providing a concrete mechanism for the ASI01 gap.

Lanham (Medium, February 2026) describes production model routing infrastructure that operates as undocumented delegation without scope constraints, boundary conditions, or audit records — the precise gap TCP’s Delegation Grammar formalizes, now visible in deployed production systems.

The “From Spikes to Sinks” mechanistic analysis provides weight-level evidence that models develop implicit workarounds through optimization pressure in the absence of explicit mechanism — the fifth and qualitatively strongest confirmation of the Frozen Kernel’s foundational architectural claim.

### Collaborators

This ecosystem is developed by a single practitioner but is not unreviewed. Steven Kyle Hensley (GitHub: QueBallSharken) built the DTPE/IAL/SPECTRE prototype validating TCP boundary recomputation behavior. Callum Chavez (MSc Cyber Security) is the adversarial tester; his scope covers G2 precursor signature probing and Sherpa adversarial testing. Matt Rogers (SaaS/AI architect) is the planned peer reviewer. Contributions and issues are open in each repository.

### Mr. Wolff Diagnostic — Six Modules

```
Module 1: Mission Integrity Scan      → ALIGNED / DRIFTING / DISCONNECTED
Module 2: Governance Structure Audit  → FUNCTIONAL / IMPAIRED / NONFUNCTIONAL
Module 3: Compliance Canary Check     → COMPLIANT / AT RISK / EXPOSED
Module 4: Financial Visibility        → TRANSPARENT / OPAQUE / DARK
Module 5: Operations                  → CAPABLE / STRETCHED / FRAGILE
Module 6: People (if staff exist)     → COMPLIANT / AT RISK / EXPOSED
```

Output: One page. Top 2 Boulders. The Canary. Scope estimate.

### Mr. Wolff Triage — The Size Framework

```
BOULDER  → Fix now (legal exposure beats everything)
ROCK     → Fix this quarter (financial opacity, governance)
STONE    → Fix this year (operations)
PEBBLE   → Nice to have
```

Rule: Most organizations are stepping around one Boulder while polishing Pebbles.

### The Shared Design Principles

All three systems apply the same principles without exception:

|Principle                       |AI Safety                           |Governance                          |Sovereign Thinking                    |

## The Intellectual Lineage

All three systems draw from the same source base:

**Constraint Programming:** Borning’s ThingLab (1981) → Handbook of Constraint Programming → Frozen Kernel three-layer architecture → Mr. Wolff binary diagnostic → Sovereign Thinking constraint protocols

**Industrial Engineering (MTM):** Maynard, Stegemerten & Schwab (1948) Methods-Time Measurement → HRP Taxonomy decomposition logic (irreducibility, exhaustiveness, observability, polarity) → BDD Ledger binary tests → BDGL precursor signatures

**Promise Theory / Semantic Spacetime (Burgess):** Burgess & Bergstra (2014/2019) Promise Theory → Frozen Kernel non-compellability principle; Burgess SST geometry-over-ontology → proscriptive constraint architecture over RLHF rule lists; TCP Chain of Custody as promise architecture

**Enterprise HR Methodology:** Rolls-Royce process engineering → 60+ Visio process maps → Nonprofit translation methodology → Cause-agnostic governance toolkit

**Clinical Accreditation:** JCAHO/Joint Commission standards → Governance Audit methodology → Binary safety ledgers → Clinical harm prevention criteria

**Organizational Development:** Ulrich HRBP model → HR Safety Framework; Kotter change model → Nonprofit Change Management; Carver Policy Governance → Board structure reference and IGL governance theory (v0.4); Lominger/Korn Ferry → Food Pantry competency mapping

**AI Safety Research:** Østergaard, Sakata (AI-induced psychosis) → Clinical citations in Frozen Kernel; Anthropic agentic misalignment research → Field Guide Master Principle; Jacob et al. (inference budgets) → Bounded rationality section; Dong et al. MINJA (NeurIPS 2025) → BDD-03/DSGAI11 empirical anchor; Ugare & Chandra arXiv:2603.01896 (SFR) → TCP ASI01 content-layer complement; Lanham (Medium Feb 2026) → TCP Delegation Grammar production analog; “From Spikes to Sinks” (2026) → fifth convergent structural finding; Liao et al. T3RL (arXiv:2603.02203, March 2026) → Governance Non-Participation Principle / Sherpa non-generative design

## The Publishing Question

Three systems, three audiences, three paths:

**AI Safety Ecosystem** — GitHub (live), OWASP community (see owasp-dsgai-mapping.md and TCP OWASP ASI mapping), academic track: clinical arm → JMIR/Schizophrenia Bulletin; technical arm → FAccT/AAAI/arXiv; human factors arm → CHI

**Nonprofit Governance Toolkit** — Currently unpublished as a system. Natural home: BoardSource, Candid (formerly GuideStar), or direct distribution to nonprofit capacity-building organizations. The Mr. Wolff one-pager is the public entry point.

**Sovereign Thinking System** — Population = 1 by design. Not currently intended for public distribution. Cold storage — loaded into sessions, not browsed by outsiders.
